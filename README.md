# 📊 Student Event Feedback Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This project is the **third task** of my internship, where I designed and developed a **Power BI dashboard** to analyze **student event feedback**. The dashboard provides **insights into student perceptions, event ratings, and engagement patterns** using a real dataset.

## 🎯 Objectives
* Collect and analyze **feedback from students** about various events.
* Visualize **key performance indicators (KPIs)** for event success.
* Identify the **highest-rated and lowest-rated events**.
* Enable **interactive data exploration** with filters and visuals.

## 📈 Key Features
* **KPI Cards** with icons for:
  * 📝 **Total Feedback Count**
  * ⭐ **Average Rating**
  * 🏆 **Top Rated Event**
  * ⚠️ **Lowest Rated Event**
* **Word Cloud** to highlight common feedback themes.
* **Bar and Pie Charts** for event-wise rating distribution.
* **Conditional formatting & custom icons** to enhance readability.
* **Dynamic DAX measures** to calculate KPIs.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **Google Colab** → Data cleaning and preprocessing (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib).
* **Microsoft Power BI** → Dashboard creation, DAX measures, and visual storytelling.
* **GitHub** → Version control and project documentation.

## 🚀 Outcomes
* Built a **professional and interactive dashboard** for decision-making.
* Enhanced skills in **data analysis, DAX, Power BI visualization, and storytelling**.
* Learned to combine **Python-based preprocessing** with **Power BI reporting** for end-to-end analysis.
